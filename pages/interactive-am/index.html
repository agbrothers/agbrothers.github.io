            Human memory is governed by association. We tend to remember things that are highly related 
            to, or associated with, what we are currently seeing, hearing, thinking, and so on. To 
            demonstrate how models of associative memory work to my colleagues, I started tinkering 
            on a live 3D visualization tool. After falling down a Desmos rabbit hole, I found it very 
            helpful for reinforcing my own understanding, and I think it might be useful for anyone else 
            trying to build a stronger intuition for how they work. 
            
            <br/><br/>
            
            As shown above, we model memories (the light blue points) as attractors, each surrounded 
            by a big well, called a basin of attraction. Our current state of mind (the red point) follows 
            the slope of the wells downward, being pulled towards the most similar memory. This closely 
            resembles planets and gravity wells, with our thoughts following trajectories through memory 
            space. 

            <br/><br/>

            The implementation in Desmos follows the generalized dense associative memory formula outlined 
            in the ICML 2025 tutorial on <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06211" title="Desmos" class="underline"><em>
            Modern Methods in Associative Memory</em></a> by Krotov et al., and lets you easily swap out different 
            similarity functions, separation functions, memories, temperature, and queries to see their 
            influence on the energy landscape and recall dynamics in real time. <span style="color:#FF3D3E;" class="font-semibold">Click on the video above </span> to
